Before digging into any interesting content, I must
firmly answer why this blog exists. Why am I choosing to write a blog and what
can you get out of it? There are many reasons to write a blog, and I am
motivated by several of them:

**Self-reflection: **

Blogging
is a form of self-reflection where the
writer synthesizes many sources of information into a more concise piece of
writing. When organizing thoughts into cohesive writing, the process requires
the writer to reflect on and organize what they learned. Synthesizing and
better understanding what I do is a powerful form of personal growth. This also
can make for interesting stories with valuable information for the readers
packed in concisely.

**Personal growth:**

I
recognize that this year the value I want to focus the most on in my life is
personal growth. Growth can happen in many aspects of our lives. Today it
amuses me that I have had to accept that I have grown to be half a foot shorter
than my dad is at 6'5\. This was a rather petty form of personal growth which I
accepted as such when I made a new friend who was one of the shorter
peopleI know who turned out to be the
most charismatic person I know. He never let height get in his way of achieving
success or convincing those around him of something. It seems so silly and
obvious, but moving beyond these sorts of petty things is necessary. Other
areas of personal growth are far less static and predictable, such as problem
solving ability. People can grow their minds so much that they not only solve
problems several times faster, but also approach problems they couldn't even
begin to solve in the past. This is just scratching the surface, and reading
blogs such as [Zenhabits][0], [Steve Pavlina][1], [Gwern][2], and the [four hour workweek][3] has inspired me. I may not reach the
inspiring levels that they have, but I certainly won't even get close if I don't try. 

Writing
is a skill that I have gotten acceptably good at, but only improved at the
behest of teachers and parents. Being able to communicate with and convince our
fellow human beings is an invaluable skill that permeates all aspects of our
lives. Through practice, revision, and feedback I will become a better writer
as this blog continues. With that in mind I want this content to resonate and
be applicable for you the reader without descending into platitudes and blanket
generalities. Probably the bigger concern is my tendency to delve into domain
specifics and details not worth your time because they ramble on and are mostly
inapplicable to your life. I will try to start with topics of personal growth
and productivity that are fairly general so this doesn't become an issue. If I
start delving too deep, I will implement a tagging/subject system so you can
read the posts which are likely to connect with you. 

**Accountability:**

Have
you ever done something, not put in your full effort, and came out with a
result that made you feel proud? It makes it seem even better that you did so
well without trying, instead of actually trying your best. That makes it easy
to imagine just how well you could do if you truly tried your best. In
psychology this is a form of self-handicapping, and keeping this attitude
prevents you from ever reaching your potential. I fall prey to this, and I need
to be accountable to try my best. To be honest I fear deep down that I will try
my best and not live up to personal and public expectations. This is silly
however, because of the adaptive nature of the human body and mind. The more I
push myself the more I will adapt to push myself even further. If I do fail in
some ways, at least I will actually know what my limitations are and which ones
I can grow to supersede. This is where accountability comes in, because I
certainly hope I can meet every one of you willing to take the time to read
this. If you see or work with me on something, I want to know what you see me
doing right. Just as important, I want you to point out something I can improve
and challenge me to do so. I hope I can cheer you on and do the same for you.

**Adventure:**

Benjamin
Franklin is famous for saying "Either write something worth reading or do something worth
writing". Why not do both? That is what a blog like this is about after
all, you try stuff, write about it, and put it up for an audience to read. I
intend to embark upon an adventure that fulfills all of these. Graduating
college opens up aworld of
possibilities, but most of them seem to end in full time jobs which limit
personal growth. I have had the privilege of working at DocuSign, which seems
to do about the best a large corporation can at treating you like a human
being. As a growing technology company with a worthy purpose, working there is
the sort of opportunity one might expect to see a few times over their life.
Starting a company that makes as much sense as my current idea does and fits so
well into my life is an opportunity that most people never get. Both are valid
choices with their pros and cons, but I personally am irresistibly drawn to the
adventure. I certainly hope you enjoy being along for the read!
