my mission for 2016 here is a quick and relevant story:</p><p>Imagine waking up on
Christmas morning, getting your swimsuit on, going past the gifts, ignoring the
fireplace which is so comfortable to lounge next to, and walking to the Puget
Sound for a swim. As you walk up to the water, the air itself feels cold enough
to dissuade you. But you pop on your goggles, and prepare to plunge in. Walking
in the water is a shock, the mind reacts unconsciously with aversion. Plunging
all the way on for a lap doesn’t seem too much worse…at first. Then it hits, a
series of sensations and responses known as the mammalian diving reflex. As
your heart rate slows you actually feel relaxed and at peace for a moment. Then
the vasoconstriction hits along with the muscles of the skin tightening. It
feels like someone ran you through a shrink wrapping machine because of the
tightened skin and shift of blood flow squeeze you so hard. At this point you
have to accept the physiological response and push on to complete a lap, but
not push yourself to hypothermia. It feels intense, but the initial shock was
the worst and that’s over. After swimming a lap, each step out of the water
feels warmer and warmer as less and less water is seeping heat away from you.
After drying off only your toes still feel cold, inside the chest feels like a
metabolic fire has started. Feeling simultaneously relaxed and energized, it is
time to take on the day!</p><p>This sort of thing
is something that you have to try to truly understand the experience, but
imagining it is the next best thing. Now most of you probably think I am crazy
for actually doing what was described. I intend to overturn that notion,
because I do these sorts of things for personal growth. How does forcing
oneself to jump into shockingly cold water helpwith growth? First, health benefits have been found across a number of
studies and areas such as heart health, fat loss, and depression reduction (<a data-grid-id="b92dc2dc-a146-4bf3-8cdb-fcb2dfce4b6a" href="https://examine.com/supplements/cold-exposure/">see here</a>).
Second and more important to me is the psychological challenge. Willpower <a data-grid-id="23dafbfe-d227-4dd5-b0f3-2d0ef08c84de" href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx">is
like a muscle</a> and is strengthened when you push yourself to do things that make you
uncomfortable. Having the mental strength to push myself to take the plunge
literally helps take more challenging figurative plunges in other areas of my
life that are a part of my mission.</p><p>My mission and focus this year
is on building solutions to digital distraction. I will turn this passion into a
business that gains profit in return for positively impacting people's lives through their productivity.
The first step and primary focus is taking individuals like myself who can perform
productively and helping them become even more productive by freeing them from
distractions such as email, Facebook, and anything else that gets in the way of
their productivity. How will this transition into solving internet addiction?
That is the topic of future posts. Right now I am simply planting my flag in
the ground for 2016. This is the year I graduate college, start a successful
business, and document the ensuing personal growth and adventure on this blog.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="51"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="53"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="54"><span data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><h2 data-reactid="57"><a data-reactid="58">What do you see in 2016?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="61"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="62"></div></section></div></div>
